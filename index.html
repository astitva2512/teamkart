                    We participate and represent IIT Kharagpur in various formula student competitions across the globe. If you love the adrenaline rush from sweat and the smell of burning gasoline, we are the ones you should be around. Our engines have been roaring since we were founded in 2008, and we won't be putting on the brakes any time soon! 'Know More' to turn the ignition key on and dive deep into the world of the only automotve research group on campusâ€¦.</p></div>

                <div><p>'Formula Student' competitions are student engineering competitions held each year in countries across the world. Student teams from around the world design, build, test and race a formula style race car. The cars are judged on various criteria, and evaluation is done on the team's performance in the static and dynamic events. You may have the fastest car on the grid, but it does not mean anything if it can't take the brunt of the man trying to pulverize the brake pedal during technical inspection!</p>
